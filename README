Comedi::Lib

This module provides a Perl API for Comedilib. Comedilib is a separately
distributed package containing a user-space library that provides a 
developer-friendly interface to the Comedi devices. This module consists of
the functions that the Comedilib library provides.

TODO

I don't use XS, C::Scan or something like that, to export constants and macros
to the callers name-space, as long as it's not clarified which constants and
macros used for Comedilib and which for 'pure' Comedi (driver development).
Both the documentation and the source code couldn't help me at all to resolve
that problem.

NOTE

This module does _not_ support any ALPHA constants, macros or functions.
This will be done by a separately module, anytime soon.
